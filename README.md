## Installation

GBFlatButton is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "GBFlatButton"
```

But if you don't use CocoaPods, you can just copy the `Classes` folder into your project.

## Usage

To create a flat button programmatically, just instantiate a new `GBFlatButton` with a frame and add it to some view, for example:

```objc
GBFlatButton *button = [[GBFlatButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(originX, originY, width, height)];
button.tintColor = [UIColor orangeColor]; // or import UIColor+GBFlatButton.h and use our cool colors
[button setTitle:@"An orange button" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[self.view addSubview:button];
```

But you can also create a `GBFlatButton` via Interface Builder. To do it, drag a `UIButton` and drop it onto your view, change its custom class to `GBFlatButton` and customize it inside its File's Owner. For example:

```objc
@implementation MyViewController ()
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet GBFlatButton *flatButton;
@end

@implementation MyViewController
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    _flatButton.tintColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
}
@end
```

### Note

For iOS > 7.0, you can set the value of tintColor directly via Interface Builder.
